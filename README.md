# 📊 **Statistical Analysis of Chicago Crime (2019-2024)**  

🚀 **An interactive data-driven analysis of Chicago crime trends using statistical modeling, time-series analysis, and geospatial visualization.**  

## 🔍 **Overview**  
This project explores **Chicago crime data (2019-2024)** to identify trends in crime types, seasonal variations, spatial concentrations, and arrest patterns. Using **R and statistical models**, we provide insights into crime fluctuations before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.  

## 📌 **Key Features**  
✅ **Crime Trends Analysis** – Study shifts in crime patterns over time  
✅ **Seasonal & Temporal Insights** – Identify peak crime months and times of day  
✅ **Geospatial Mapping** – Use heatmaps to pinpoint crime hotspots  
✅ **Arrest Trends** – Compare arrest vs. non-arrest rates across crime types  
✅ **Property vs. Physical Crimes** – Examine trends across different crime categories  

## 📂 **Data Sources**  
📄 [Chicago Crime Dataset (2001-Present)](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/about_data)  
📄 Additional datasets: Arrest records, police station locations, school reports  

## 🛠️ **Methodology**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizations of crime trends & hotspots  
- **Time-Series Analysis** – Trends in crime frequency over the years  
- **Geospatial Analysis** – Mapping crime density using heatmaps  
- **Clustering & Correlation** – Understanding crime relationships with socioeconomic factors  

## 📊 **Key Findings**  
📌 **Theft is the most common crime**, dropping during COVID-19 but rebounding in 2023  
📌 **Summer months (May–October) see a 15-20% crime increase**, driven by tourism & outdoor activity  
📌 **60% of crimes occur at night**, influenced by reduced police presence & darkness  
📌 **Vehicle theft spikes from July to November**, likely due to increased travel  
📌 **Crime hotspots include Community Areas 8 & 32**, with theft & battery most prevalent  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  

### 🔹 Programming Languages & Tools  
- **R** – Primary language for statistical modeling & visualization  
- **Kali Linux Terminal** – Data extraction & filtering  
- **RStudio** – Development environment for R  

### 🔹 Libraries & Frameworks  
#### 🖥 **R Packages:**

## 🛠 How to Run the Project  

### 1️⃣ **Set Up the Environment**  
#### Install R and required packages:  
```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "lubridate", "tidyverse", "sf"))
```
### 2️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chicago-crime-analysis.git
cd chicago-crime-analysis
```

### 3️⃣ **Run the Analysis**  
- Open **RStudio**   
- Load the dataset (CSV)  
- Execute the R scripts to generate visualizations and insights  


## 📌 **Future Enhancements**  
🔹 Use **ARIMA or Prophet models** to predict future crime trends  
🔹 Improve **geospatial mapping** using advanced tools like Leaflet & sf  
🔹 Incorporate **socioeconomic indicators** to assess crime correlations
